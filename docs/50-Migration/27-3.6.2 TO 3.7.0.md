# Framework from v3.6.2 to v3.7.0

## AUTOMATIC MIGRATION

1. Use the BIAToolKit to migrate the project

2. Manage the confict (2 solutions)
   1. In BIAToolKit click on "4 - merge Rejected" and search "<<<<<" in all files.  
    * Resolve the conflit manualy.
   2. Analyse the .rej file (search "diff a/" in VS code) that have been created in your project folder
     * Apply manualy the change.

3. Change source path and run the script [V3.6.2_to_V3.7.0_Replacement.ps1](./Scripts/V3.6.2_to_V3.7.0_Replacement.ps1) 

4. Apply other manual step (describe bellow) at the end if all is ok, you can remove the .rej files (durring the process they can be usefull to resolve build probleme)

## MANUAL STEPS

### FRONT

#### 1. For screens that use views

1. In **index.component.html**, in **bia-table-controller**, add **tableState** param.

   ```html
   <bia-table-controller
   ...
   [tableState]="tableState"
   ></bia-table-controller>
   ```

2. In **index.component.html**, in **bia-table**, add sortFieldValue and stateSave params

   ```html
   <bia-table
   ...
   [sortFieldValue]="sortFieldValue"
   (stateSave)="onStateSave($event)"
   ></bia-table>
   ```

3. In **index.component.ts**, add the following member variables (above the constructor) and filled in the value of **sortFieldValue**

```ts
tableState: string;
sortFieldValue = 'the name of the column sorted by default';
```

### BACK

1. Modified your **DtoToRecord** methods (use for CSV extract) of the **Mapper** classes in the **Domain** layer by following the example in the **BIADemo** project:
**TheBIADevCompany.BIADemo.Domain.PlaneModule.Aggregate.PlaneMapper**

2. Move all your WorkerService jobs in application layer :
   1. Cut all classes in ...WorkerService\Job 
   2. Paste them in ...Application\Job
   3. modify the namespace => replace ```WorkerService.Job``` by ```Application.Job```
   4. the class should be public (change it if there are private or internal).
   5. resolve using in ...WorkerService\Worker.cs

3. Move the reccuring jobs init in DeployDB
   1. Search ```RecurringJob.AddOrUpdate``` in ...WorkerService\Worker.cs
   2. Move this code after  RecurringJob.AddOrUpdate<SynchronizeUserTask> of ...DeployDB\Program.cs
   3. Copie the "Tasks" settings from ...WorkerService\appsettings.json to ...DeployDB\appsettings.json
   4. In ...WorkerService\appsettings.json the "CRON" values can be remove ex: 
      ```json
         "Tasks": {
            "WakeUp": {
               "Url": "http://localhost/BIADemo/App|http://localhost/BIADemo/WebApi/api/Auth/frontEndVersion"
            },
         },
      ```     
   5. In ...DeployDB\appsettings.json only the "CRON" values should be keep: 
      ```json
         "Tasks": {
            "WakeUp": {
               "CRON": "0 6-17 * * *"
            },
            "SynchronizeUser": {
               "CRON": "0 6 * * *"
            }
         },
      ```

## BUILD

1. Due to .Net 6.0 you should change the build task to use Visual Studio 2022:
   * Add a Task "Visual Studio build (Side-by-side)" and set the same parameter than the "Build solution" Task.
   * Remove the old Task "Build solution"
2. Adapt the copy path 
   * In the 3 copy tasks replace net5.0 by net6.0

## DEPLOY

1. The service worker should be deploy as a windows service and not more as web Application:
   * In all environment, change the version of the task "Deploy Service as Web" used the V3 (BIA Deploy Service - V3.7.0 - *) and rename the task "Deploy Service"
