# Framework from v3.6.2 to v3.7.0

## AUTOMATIC MIGRATION

1. Use the BIAToolKit to migrate the project

2. Manage the confict (2 solutions)
   1. In BIAToolKit click on "4 - merge Rejected" and search "<<<<<" in all files.  
    * Resolve the conflit manualy.
   2. Analyse the .rej file (search "diff a/" in VS code) that have been created in your project folder
     * Apply manualy the change.

3. Change source path and run the script [V3.6.2_to_V3.7.0_Replacement.ps1](./Scripts/V3.6.2_to_V3.7.0_Replacement.ps1) 

4. Apply other manual step (describe bellow) at the end if all is ok, you can remove the .rej files (durring the process they can be usefull to resolve build probleme)

## MANUAL STEPS

### FRONT

#### 1. For screens that use views

1. In **index.component.html**, in **bia-table-controller**, add **tableState** param.

   ```html
   <bia-table-controller
   ...
   [tableState]="tableState"
   ></bia-table-controller>
   ```

2. In **index.component.html**, in **bia-table**, add sortFieldValue and stateSave params

   ```html
   <bia-table
   ...
   [sortFieldValue]="sortFieldValue"
   (stateSave)="onStateSave($event)"
   ></bia-table>
   ```

3. In **index.component.ts**, add the following member variables (above the constructor) and filled in the value of **sortFieldValue**

```ts
tableState: string;
sortFieldValue = 'the name of the column sorted by default';
```

### BACK

1. Modified your **DtoToRecord** methods (use for CSV extract) of the **Mapper** classes in the **Domain** layer by following the example in the **BIADemo** project:
**TheBIADevCompany.BIADemo.Domain.PlaneModule.Aggregate.PlaneMapper**

2. Move all your WorkerService jobs in application layer :
   1. Cut all classes in ...WorkerService\Job 
   2. Paste them in ...Application\Job
   3. modify the namespace => replace ```WorkerService.Job``` by ```Application.Job```
   4. the class should be public (change it if there are private or internal).
   5. resolve using in ...WorkerService\Worker.cs
