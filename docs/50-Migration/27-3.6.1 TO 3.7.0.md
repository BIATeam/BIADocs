## AUTOMATIC MIGRATION

1. Use the BIAToolKit to migrate the project

2. Manage the confict (2 solutions)
   1. In BIAToolKit click on "4 - merge Rejected" and search "<<<<<" in all files.  
    * Resolve the conflit manualy.
   2. Analyse the .rej file (search "diff a/" in VS code) that have been created in your project folder
     * Apply manualy the change.

3. Apply other manual step (describe bellow) at the end if all is ok, you can remove the .rej files (durring the process they can be usefull to resolve build probleme)

4. Change source path and run the script [V3.6.1_to_V3.7.0_Replacement.ps1](./Scripts/V3.6.1_to_V3.7.0_Replacement.ps1) 

## MANUAL STEPS

### FRONT

#### 1. For screens that use views

1. In **index.component.html**, in **bia-table-controller**, add **tableState** param.

   ```html
   <bia-table-controller
   ...
   [tableState]="tableState"
   ></bia-table-controller>
   ```

2. In **index.component.html**, in **bia-table**, add sortFieldValue and stateSave params

   ```html
   <bia-table
   ...
   [sortFieldValue]="sortFieldValue"
   (stateSave)="onStateSave($event)"
   ></bia-table>
   ```

3. In **index.component.ts**, add the following member variables (above the constructor) and filled in the value of **sortFieldValue**

```ts
tableState: string;
sortFieldValue = 'the name of the column sorted by default';
```

### BACK

1. Modified your **DtoToRecord** methods of the **Mapper** classes in the **Domain** layer by following the example in the **BIADemo** project:
**TheBIADevCompany.BIADemo.Domain.PlaneModule.Aggregate.PlaneMapper**
