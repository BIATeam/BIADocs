# v4.0.0 to v4.0.2

## AUTOMATIC MIGRATION
 
1. Use the BIAToolKit to migrate the project
2. Delete all **package-lock.json** and **node_modules** folder

3. Manage the conflicts (2 solutions)
   1. In BIAToolKit click on "4 - merge Rejected" and search `<<<<<` in all files.  
    * Resolve the conflicts manually.
   2. Analyze the .rej file (search "diff a/" in VS code) that have been created in your project folder
     * Apply manually the change.

4. If all is ok, you can remove the .rej files (during the process they can be useful to resolve build problems)

5. Resolve missing and obsolete usings with BIAToolKit

6. Launch the command **npm install** and the command **npm audit fix**
