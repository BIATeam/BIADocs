# v4.0.0 to v4.1.0

## ANGULAR 18 MIGRATION
### Instructions
1. Run update command : `npm run ng update @angular/core@18 @angular/cli@18 @angular-eslint/schematics@18 @angular/cdk@17 @ngrx/store@18 keycloak-angular@16`
2. Select the optional migration **[use-application-builder]** when requested by the update of @angular/cli

### Notable changes
1. `HttpClientModule` is deprecated. Imports into providers `provideHttpClient(withInterceptorsFromDi())` instead.
2. Usage of native event names for component's outputs (`cancel`, `click`...) is now considered as error.
3. By using the new application builder system, configure into **angular.json** the `outputPath.browser` property to `""` to preserve original output path instead of a new subfolder `browser`.
4. `Time` is deprecated.

### Migration guides
- [Angular](https://angular.dev/update-guide?v=17.0-18.0&l=3)
- [NgRx](https://ngrx.io/guide/migration/v18)


## AUTOMATIC MIGRATION
 
1. Use the BIAToolKit to migrate the project
2. Delete all **package-lock.json** and **node_modules** folder

3. Manage the conflicts (2 solutions)
   1. In BIAToolKit click on "4 - merge Rejected" and search `<<<<<` in all files.  
    * Resolve the conflicts manually.
   2. Analyze the .rej file (search "diff a/" in VS code) that have been created in your project folder
     * Apply manually the change.

4. Change source path and run the script [V4.0.0_to_V4.1.0_Replacement.ps1](./Scripts/V4.0.0_to_V4.1.0_Replacement.ps1)

5. Apply other manual step (describe below) at the end if all is ok, you can remove the .rej files (during the process they can be useful to resolve build problems)

6. Resolve missing and obsolete usings with BIAToolKit

7. Launch the command **npm install** and the command **npm audit fix**

## MANUAL STEPS
